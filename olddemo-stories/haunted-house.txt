<h1>DEMO STORY</h>

<h2>Haunted House</h2>

<h3>Daniel Wittgenstein</h3>

This is just a short demo story.
It uses current features of Jinx (October 2022).
In the meantime, Jinx is not finished and
more features will be added to it in the future,
so this is not an extensive showcase of
all of Jinx's features by any means.

You enter the Haunted House.

+ okay
-
You find yourself inside a living room. Everything is dusty and
old, but that's what you would expect from a Haunted
House, isn't it?

+ Keep exploring

+ Look at the grandfather's clock
	An arrow shoots out of the clock and misses you by mere
  inches. Jeez! You already thought this is one of those
  stories where you die all the time.
  Glad you survived at least one turn.
  
 	You decide to leave this living room of death and keep exploring
  the house.
 
-

You enter the next room. It's a kitchen.

.goto kitchen

=== kitchen

+ (if !v.opened_fridge) Open the fridge

	#v.opened_fridge = true
	You open the fridge. There's only an apple inside it.
  
  ++ take the apple
  	You take the apple. Who knows, it might come in handy later.
    #v.apple = true
  
  ++ leave it alone
	
  --
  .goto kitchen

+ (if !v.pan) Take a pan
	You grab a pan. Not the best weapon, but it's a start.
	# v.pan = true
	.goto kitchen

+ Keep exploring

You keep exploring ...
.goto staircase

=== staircase

The next room is a staircase. The stairs only lead down.

+ Go down

You walk down the stairs and find yourself in a dimly-lit wine cellar.

There's a dog here, a husky with a red scarf.

.if v.apple
	"Do you have an apple?", she says, "Yes, you have one!
  Great! Now we can make cidre."
  
  "Weird", you say, "I didn't know that huskies enjoy cidre."
  
  "And that's the only th√≠ng you find weird about this setting?",
  the husky asks.
  
.else
	"Why didn't you take the apple?", she says in a sad
  voice, "Now we cannot make cidre."
