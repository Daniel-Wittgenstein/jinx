<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    This plugin provides a simple standard user
    interface with save, load and undo functionality.
</p>

<h2>Maximum undo</h2>
<p>
    By default, the player can undo 7 turns.
    To change this, put this line at the beginning of your game:
</p>

<pre>
    # simpleInterface.setMaxUndo(5) 
</pre>

<p>
    The above example would set the maximum undo limit to 5 turns.
    Setting this number to somewhere between 0 (no undo at all) and 20
    is reasonable. (Theoretically you could go up to one million and higher,
    but the higher this number is, the more memory your game will eat up.)
    Also, do not use this command twice in the same story.
</p>

<h2>Changing button texts</h2>

Here's how you can change the button texts (for example for localization).
For example, for a German game, you might want to put this at the beginning of your game:

<pre>
    # simpleInterface.setButtonText("load", "Laden")
    # simpleInterface.setButtonText("save", "Speichern")
    # simpleInterface.setButtonText("erase", "Laden")
    # simpleInterface.setButtonText("undo", "Rückgängig")
</pre>
